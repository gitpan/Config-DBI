=head1 NAME

  Config::DBI - database connection support via Config::ApacheFormat files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In .cshrc:

  setenv DBI_CONF dbi.conf

In dbi.conf:

 # Pass may be a password, or <STDIN> in which case, the password is 
 # is prompted for:

 Pass	     <STDIN>

 # Connect attribute

 # dbi_connect_method is a standard part of DBI. Its casing does differ from
 # all other attributes, but I did not create the DBI spec, I am simply
 # following it:
 # http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI-1.38/DBI.pm#DBI_Class_Methods

 # Other options for this value are: connect_cached, Apache::DBI::connect

 dbi_connect_method connect 

 # Attributes common to all handles and settable
 # Listed in the order given in the DBI docs.

 <DBI basic>
  DSN              dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb

  AutoCommit  1
 </DBI>

 # Description of another database

 <DBI basic_test>
  DSN   dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb_test
  User  test
  Pass  test
 </DBI>

In Ye Olde Pure Perl Programme:

  use Config::DBI;

  my $dbh = Config::DBI->basic_test;

Or:

  my %connect = Config::DBI->hash('basic_test');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Config::DBI is a module based on 2 years of developing and using
DBIx::Connect. For most usage, DBIx::Connect was fine. However two principal
issues began to loom with continued usage. First, AppConfig is very hard
to use and understand. So maintenance of the code was a real headache. Second,
it was difficult to arrange an AppConfig file to create over-writable
defaults. The concerns led to the following post:

    http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=299749

A reply by Perrin led me to develop a completely new module based on
Config::ApacheFormat.

This module's main purpose is to provide a way to get DBI database handles
with very few lines of code. It does also have an API call to get the
connection data so that you can do what you want with it. This is useful
when one is using DBIx::AnyDBD or some other package which has 
different conventions for creating DBI C<dbh>s.


=head1 INSTALLATION and USAGE

=head2 Create a DBI configuration file

A documented sample one, C<dbi.conf>, comes with the distribution.

No directives are allowed in this file other than 
C<User>, C<Pass>, C<DSN>, C<DBI> and the names of the DBI attributes.

=head2 Create the DBI_CONF environmental variable in your .bashrc

Set this to the name of the configuration file that Config::DBI will be using.

  export DBI_CONF=$HOME/dbi.conf

=head2 Source .bashrc

  shell> source ~/.bashrc

=head2 Run scripts/try-connect.pl try it out:

    ~/hacks/config-dbi/scripts $ perl -I../lib try-connect.pl
 Connection successful.
    ~/hacks/config-dbi/scripts $ 

=head2 Install it

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install



=head1 METHODS

=head2 my $dbh = Config::DBI->$DBI_block

This method looks for a DBI block labeled C<$DBI_block> and loads in the 
configuration information from that block as well as its parents. It then
creates and returns a DBI database handle.

Should an error occur and C<HandleError> is unbound, then
C<$DBI::errstr> is printed with a die. If C<HandleError> is defined, then
its called per the DBI spec.

=head2 my %hash = Config::DBI->hash($DBI_block);

This method returns a hash of DBI connection data. Here is a sample of
what such data would look like from the config file in the L</SYNOPSIS>.

  $VAR1 = {
          'DSN' => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb',
          'User' => 'postgres',
          'Pass' => undef,
          'Attr' => {
                      'Profile' => '0',
                      'FetchHashKeyName' => '0',
                      'TraceLevel' => '0',
                      'HandleError' => sub { "DUMMY" },
                      'InactiveDestroy' => 1,
                      'AutoCommit' => '1',
                      'TaintOut' => '0',
                      'RaiseError' => '0',
                      'LongTruncOk' => '0',
                      'ChopBlanks' => '0',
                      'PrintError' => '0',
                      'dbi_connect_method' => 'connect',
                      'LongReadLen' => '0',
                      'Warn' => '1',
                      'ShowErrorStatement' => '1',
                      'TaintIn' => '1'
                    }
        };


=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Most of the information for this section is a regurgitation of:

    http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=292455

=head2 DBIx::Password

The very first module to abstract the process of DBI database connections.
Repeated rejection of my patches to this module to support methods such as
the C<hash()> method of this package led to the creation of DBIx::Connect.

=head2 XML::Object::DBI

This module does connection and SQL warehousing via XML.

=head2 Ima::DBI

Ima:DBI is part of the tech stack Perl's most popular Perl database wrapper,
Class::DBI. It does connection and SQL warehousing via Perl.

=head2 DBIx::Connect

The first module I wrote to address what I could not address under the
auspices of DBIx::Password.
